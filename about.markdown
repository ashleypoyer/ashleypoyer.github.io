My name is Ashley, I grew up in the DC area and am currently studying data science and math at Penn State. I have a passion for learning new things in general; although, most of what you'll find on this site falls under the umbrella of "data science".

When I'm not reading about all things related to data science I like to spend my time playing racquetball or trying out new coffee shops.
